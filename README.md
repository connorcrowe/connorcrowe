# 🌎 Data Background, Product Focus, Geospatial Passion
Hi, I'm Connor--- a data-driven product manager with a background in Computer Engineering and a passion for machine learning, geospatial analysis, and urban planning. I've built products in startups and mid-sized organisations in deep tech, health-tech and education-tech. 

I am on a journey to transition into the geospatial industry to leverage my skills towards the problems that I'm most personally passionate about - *climate change, urbanism, & transportation planning*.
